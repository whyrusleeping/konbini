# Konbini - A Cozy Bluesky AppView

Konbini is a partially indexed bluesky appview. It's aim is to provide a "Friends of Friends" experience to the bluesky network.

It is currently _very_ jank and I really just hacked this together in a day. More work to come when I get time.

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.25.1 or later
- PostgreSQL database
- Node.js and npm (for frontend)
- Docker (optional, for easy PostgreSQL setup)
- Bluesky account credentials

## Quick Start with Docker Compose

The easiest way to run Konbini is with Docker Compose, which will start PostgreSQL, the backend, and frontend all together.

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Creating an app password (via: https://bsky.app/settings/app-passwords)

### Setup

1. Create a `.env` file with your credentials:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add:
# - BSKY_HANDLE=your-handle.bsky.social
# - BSKY_PASSWORD=your-app-password
```

2. Start all services:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

3. Wait for the backend to index posts from the firehose (this may take a few minutes for initial indexing)

4. Open your browser to http://localhost:3000

### Stopping the services

```bash
docker-compose down
```

To also remove the database volume:

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

## Manual Setup

### 1. PostgreSQL Database Setup

#### Using Docker (Recommended)

```bash
# Start PostgreSQL container
docker run --name konbini-postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=konbini \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=konbini \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_password \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  -d postgres:15

# The database will be available at: postgresql://konbini:your_password@localhost:5432/konbini
```

### 2. Environment Configuration

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
# Database connection
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://konbini:your_password@localhost:5432/konbini"

# Bluesky credentials
export BSKY_HANDLE="your-handle.bsky.social"
export BSKY_PASSWORD="your-app-password"
```

### 3. Build and Run the Go Application

```bash
go build

# Run with environment variables
./konbini
```

### 4. Frontend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
```

The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000 and will connect to the API at http://localhost:4444.

## Running the Bluesky App against Konbini

Konbini implements a large portion of the app.bsky.\* appview endpoints that
are required for pointing the main app to it and having it work reasonably
well.

To accomplish this you will need a few things:

### Service DID

You will need a DID, preferably a did:web for your appview that points at a
public endpoint where your appview is accessible via https.
I'll get into the https proxy next, but for the did, I've just pointed a domain
I own (in my case appview1.bluesky.day) to a VPS, and used caddy to host a file
at `/.well-known/did.json`.
That file should look like this:

```json
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
    "https://w3id.org/security/multikey/v1"
  ],
  "id": "did:web:appview1.bluesky.day",
  "verificationMethod": [
    {
      "id": "did:web:api.bsky.app#atproto",
      "type": "Multikey",
      "controller": "did:web:api.bsky.app",
      "publicKeyMultibase": "zQ3shpRzb2NDriwCSSsce6EqGxG23kVktHZc57C3NEcuNy1jg"
    }
  ],
  "service": [
    {
      "id": "#bsky_notif",
      "type": "BskyNotificationService",
      "serviceEndpoint": "YOUR APPVIEW HTTPS URL"
    },
    {
      "id": "#bsky_appview",
      "type": "BskyAppView",
      "serviceEndpoint": "YOUR APPVIEW HTTPS URL"
    }
  ]
}
```

The verificationMethod isn't used but i'm not sure if _something_ is required
there or not, so i'm just leaving that there, it works on my machine.

### HTTPS Endpoint

I've been using ngrok to proxy traffic from a publicly accessible https url to my appview.
You can simply run `ngrok http 4446` and it will give you an https url that you
can then put in your DID doc above.

### The Social App

Now, clone and build the social app:

```
git clone https://github.com/bluesky-social/social-app
cd social-app
yarn
```

And then set this environment variable that tells it to use your appview:

```
export EXPO_PUBLIC_BLUESKY_PROXY_DID=did:web:YOURDIDWEB
```

And finally run the app:

```
yarn web
```

This takes a while on first load since its building everything.
After that, load the localhost url it gives you and it _should_ work.

## Selective Backfill

If you'd like to backfill a particular repo, just hit the following endpoint:

```
curl http://localhost:4444/rescan/<DID OR HANDLE>

```

It will take a minute but it should pull all records from that user.

## Upstream Firehose Configuration

Konbini supports both standard firehose endpoints as well as jetstream. If
bandwidth and CPU usage is a concern, and you trust the jetstream endpoint,
then it may be worth trying that out.

The configuration file is formatted as follows:

```json
{
  "backends": [
    {
      "type": "jetstream",
      "host": "jetstream1.us-west.bsky.network"
    }
  ]
}
```

The default (implicit) configuration file looks like this:

```json
{
  "backends": [
    {
      "type": "firehose",
      "host": "bsky.network"
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that this is an array of backends, you can specify multiple upstreams, and
konbini will read from all of them. The main intended purpose of this is to be
able to subscribe directly to PDSs. PDSs currently only support the full
firehose endpoint, not jetstream, so be sure to specify a type of "firehose"
for individual PDS endpoints.
